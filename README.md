# Wiktionary Search App
An Electron.js program to search for words on Wiktionary



## Development

#### Platform Support

* Windows 10+ (tested on 11, but should work on 10 too)

For now only Windows is supported. Linux and macOS may work, but I haven't tested so I can't say for sure.



#### Prerequisities

* Node.js (Latest LTS)
* NPM
* Git



#### Cloning

Clone the repository and enter it:

`git clone https://github.com/Alpakka31/wiktionary-search-app.git`

`cd wiktionary-search-app`



#### Building

Install program dependencies with: `npm install`

Build the program with: `npm run build`

Or build and start it afterwards with one command: `npm run start`



#### Packaging

Package the program into a Windows executable (.exe): `npm run package`

That also creates an installer for the program.
